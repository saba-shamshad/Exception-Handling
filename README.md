**Exception Handling & File Handling**

*This repository documents my hands-on learning of Java Backend concepts, focusing on Exception Handling, File Handling, and understanding Java Errors. Through practical code examples, outputs, and personal handwritten notes, I aim to build a strong foundation in backend logic and debugging.*

**📂 Project Overview**

*This project contains:*

✅ Simple Java programs for Arithmetic and File Handling

✅ Demonstration of different types of Errors and Exceptions

✅ Practical examples with screenshots of outputs

✅ Clear handwritten notes for quick conceptual understanding



**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

Java (Core + Backend Concepts)

Apache NetBeans IDE 26

Maven Build Tool

File Handling & Exception Handling in Java



**🔥 Learning Topics Covered**

1. ⚙️ Types of Errors in Java

Compile-Time Errors

Logical Errors

Runtime Errors


2. ❗ Java Exceptions Classification

Built-in (Unchecked)	User-Defined (Checked)

ArithmeticException
ClassNotFoundException
NullPointerException	
FileNotFoundException
ClassCastException
SQLException
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
IOException
ArrayStoreException
InstantiationException
IllegalThreadStateException
InterruptedException


✔ Unchecked Exceptions: Not mandatory to handle using try-catch
✔ Checked Exceptions: Mandatory to handle using try-catch


**💡 Key Takeaways**

Understand different types of errors in Java

Learn to gracefully handle exceptions using try-catch

Perform basic file handling with error control

Strengthen debugging and backend development skills


**📢 Conclusion**

This project is a part of my Java Backend learning journey. Through consistent coding, error testing,I am building confidence to handle real-world backend scenarios.
